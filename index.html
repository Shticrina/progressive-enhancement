        <h3>The story</h3>

        <p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said,</p>
        <blockquote>We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</blockquote>

        <p>The farmer said,</p>
        <blockquote><em>Maybe.</em></blockquote>

        <p>The next day the horse came back strong it, and in the evening everybody came back and said,</p>
        <blockquote>Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</blockquote>

        <p>The farmer again said,</p>
        <blockquote><em>Maybe.</em></blockquote>

        <p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said,</p>
        <blockquote>Oh dear, that’s too bad,</blockquote>

        <p>and the farmer responded,</p>
        <blockquote><em>Maybe.</em></blockquote>

        <p>The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said,</p>
        <blockquote>Isn’t that great!</blockquote> 

        <p>Again, he said,</p>
        <blockquote><em>Maybe.</em></blockquote>

        <p>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is good or bad &#8722; because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune.</p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>Good and Bad are just one perspective. Bananas are good for monkeys, but monkeys are not good for <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banane" title="this is a description of bananas" target="_blank">bananas</a>. Let's not make a big deal out of it...</p>
